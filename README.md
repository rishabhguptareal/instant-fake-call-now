FakeCall.com is a web-based service designed to simulate incoming phone calls, allowing users to create believable fake calls with just a few clicks. The app typically offers preset caller names such as "Wife,"Mom," or "Jake," which users can select without entering any phone numbers or personal information. Upon clicking a "Call Me Now" button, the app displays a realistic fake call screen with ringing sounds or prerecorded audio, mimicking an actual phone call to help users escape awkward or unwanted social situations. It operates entirely in the browser, requiring no downloads or real phone calls, making it easy, private, and instant to use. This approach is popular for quickly getting out of boring meetings, annoying conversations, or uncomfortable events by providing a believable excuse to walk away
